NOTE

The raw microdata employed in the paper comes from records of the
Relacao Anual de Informacoes Sociais (RAIS), collected from the
Brazilian Ministry of Labor. This paper uses rounds of the data 
from 1986 to 2005.

RAIS is not publicly available. I had access to it through Instituto
de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA) in Brasilia. I am grateful to
Joao De Negri for granting me access. He can be reached at 
joao.denegri@ipea.gov.br

The estimation codes can be run using the results of the auxiliary models,
as well as the empirical distribution of initial conditions, which are 
made available in the Estimation_Data folder.
