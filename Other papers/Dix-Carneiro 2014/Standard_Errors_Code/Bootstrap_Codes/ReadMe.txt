This folder contains the SAS codes used in order to compute the variance
of the auxiliary models coefficients in the data and in the simulation.

Bootstrap_New.sas computes the variance of auxiliary models coefficients fit to the data
Bootstrap_Sim_New.sas computes the variance of auxiliary models coefficients fit simulated data
